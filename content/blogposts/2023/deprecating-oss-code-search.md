We are excited to share the news about an important evolution in our product licensing strategy as we prepare for Sourcegraph 5.1. After much deliberation and thoughtful consideration, we have decided to move the code search parts of Sourcegraph from open source software (OSS) to an enterprise license for all future developments.

# Our Licensing Principle

Our licensing principle remains intact - we are committed to charging companies while keeping tools for individual developers open source. We believe in empowering individual developers and small teams with robust tools that they can freely use to build and innovate.

# Why this Change?

In our constant endeavor to provide better services to our users, we noticed a trend - very few individual developers or companies were using the open-source variant of our code search tool. In fact, the vast majority, over 99.9%, of users preferred the enterprise product.

Maintaining two separate versions of the same tool proved to be a significant burden on our engineering team, with very little perceived benefit to our users. As a result, we've made this strategic decision to focus our resources on the version of the product that most of our users are actually using and gaining value from.

# Open Code and Public Visibility

We understand that transparency is important to our customers and users. We value your trust and will continue to ensure our development process remains open and visible to the public. Therefore, while the license has changed, the source code will remain publicly available.

Individual developers can still use Sourcegraph for free on public code at sourcegraph.com and within our self-hosted free tier on private code.

# Our Commitment to Individual Developers

We are excited to introduce the community edition of our AI developer tool, Cody, which we have open-sourced under the Apache 2 license. This tool is specifically designed for individual developers and we believe that it will be the primary tool individual developers use moving forward.

The code search feature will be integrated with Cody for enterprise users, providing an even more robust and comprehensive tool for our enterprise customers.

# Continuing Support for Zoekt

We remain committed to Zoekt, the open-source code search engine, and will continue to make upstream changes to it. We believe in the power of open-source tools, and we're proud to contribute to the ecosystem by supporting projects like Zoekt.

To sum up, we believe these changes will allow us to better serve our users, helping us focus our efforts where they matter most. As always, we welcome your feedback and look forward to continuing to provide you with the tools you need to create and innovate. Thank you for your continued support and understanding.
