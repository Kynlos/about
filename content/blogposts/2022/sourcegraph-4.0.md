# Sourcegraph 4.0 Release Post

## Section 1

## Section 2


### Run batch changes server-side

<!-- @malomarrec: The title is the feature, as opposed to the benefit, because there's multiple benefits. Another angle would be to focus on the primary benefit and title this "Run batch changes at large scales" -->

Batch Changes can now run across thousands of repositories, and features a much better development experience. Until now, you had to run `src-cli` locally to create batch changes: `src-cli` would pull repo archives through Sourcegraph, and kick off docker containers locally to run your batch change. For large amounts of repositories or resource-intensive code rewrites, running src-cli locally could take an impractical amount of time or be brittle.

We're introducing the ability to run batch changes server-side instead of locally, which means you can:
- Run large-scale or resource intensive batch changes without clogging your local machine.
- Run large batch changes fast by distributing them across an autoscaled pool of compute instances.
- Get a better debugging experience, with logs being streamed directly into Sourcegraph.
- Simplify setup for end users.

This feature requires admins to set up executors (much like CI agents), which Sourcegraph will use to offload expensive tasks. Executors can also be used to run [Code Intelligence auto-indexing](#TODO-link-to-section-or-docs). If you're on cloud, one or more executors are available by default on your instance.

### Find and replace that feels like an IDE, across all your code

IDEs can find and replace strings across your local files. Sourcegraph can find and replace strings across _all_ your code. Change boilerplate, fix typos, or update configuration across all your code, without having to write a script or pull your code locally!

Just run a search query, provide a pattern to find and replace, and get a live preview of the diff. If the changes look good, Batch Changes can send them to your team for review, then automatically and safely open changesets across all your repositories, and let you track them until they get merged.

### See high-level aggregations of your search results set, to quickly answer questions about usage and structure

Sourcegraph returns an exhaustive list of search results â€“ but sometimes you need to know things like: 

- Which files have the bulk of these search results? 
- Which repos is this library used in most? 
- Which subcomponents are used most from this library?
- Who is using our new innersource library?  
- Which areas of the code added back in these regressions? 
- What are all the possible arguments we can pass to this function? 

To answer these questions, Sourcegraph now shows you your search results grouped by location (repo or file), author, and arbitrary capture group pattern. If you want to save any aggregations for future reference, you can 1-click save the results to a code insights dashboard.

### Best-in-class performance

<!-- @taylorsperry within the next couple weeks, we'll have a better understanding of the performance claims we can make against our competition -->
Sourcegraph is now faster than ever. We're using the latest in React, lazy loading, and priority rendering to deliver best-in-class performance across the app. Faster rendering means faster answers to any question about your code.

### DevX: OpenTelemetry and Sourcegraph 4.0
Today we have a myriad of tooling-specific ways for exporting observability data. OpenTelemetry (OTEL) is an open standard and set of tools that enable adopters to easily switch between different platforms for observability data, as well as extend it to fit their own backends. By adopting OpenTelemetry as a default, changing the way we export observability data, and updating various deployment methods accordingly, we can unify our internal infrastructure, eliminate technical debt, and enable customers to easily feed observability data into their own systems.

This will be a breaking change for customers - for example, for tracing today, we only export Jaeger-specific traces and ship Sourcegraph with Jaeger-specific sidecars and agents. By adopting OpenTelemetry, we would swap this out with an OpenTelemetry instance, and remove the need to have Jaeger shipped with every deployment of Sourcegraph, making Jaeger an opt-in deployment, and prompting customers to bring their own tracing backend by default.

In the future we can leverage a similar OpenTelemetry-by-default approach to integrate logs, metrics, and more in the same manner.
