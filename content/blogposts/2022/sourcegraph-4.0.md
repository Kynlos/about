# Sourcegraph 4.0

> NOTE: This post is very WIP. It's a rough draft of what individual teams intend to ship.

- [From code search toward a code intelligence platform](/blog/code-search-to-code-intelligence) - the longer-term vision/story
- [Secure, easy, and scalable Sourcegraph Cloud managed instances for the enterprise](/blog/enterprise-cloud) - the Cloud announcement (including SOC2 Type 2, etc.) that coincides with 4.0

## TL;DR

##### üåÖ Code intelligence platform for everyday use

### A faster, simpler search experience 
We‚Äôve streamlined and simplified the search interface to make the platform more intuitive. It‚Äôs easier than ever for you to get started with a homepage that includes real data from the instance including repository names, file names, and authors. These details help you uncover necessary information to run a successful search query, faster. 

Contextual tips and recommendations are provided while running a search query, and the search results are now front and center with the changes to the interface. The search sidebar has moved to the right of the screen and several non-essential elements have been removed to ensure the information you‚Äôre looking for is easy to access. Filters make it easier and faster for you to extract the answer you need, and the side bar can be collapsed altogether to reduce noise. 

Performance across the platform saw a boost and search results are now returned faster than before by using the latest in React, lazy loading, and priority rendering.

### Understand usage and search structure with high-level aggregations of search results
It‚Äôs now easier for you to derive knowledge from the codebase and get answers to your questions with high-level aggregations of search results powered by Code Insights. You can choose to group your search results by location (repo or file), author, and arbitrary capture group pattern, and a graph with the information is displayed from within the search results page. 

The new aggregations help to answer:
- Which files have the majority of these search results?
- Which repositories is this library used in most?
- Which library components are used most? By who?
- What are all the possible arguments we pass to this function?

### Configure precise code navigation for 9 languages in a matter of minutes with auto-indexing
Code navigation allows you to quickly jump to symbol definitions, find references, dependencies, and more, so you can spend more time shipping code. Precise code navigation is the most powerful version of code navigation and it works cross-repository. Auto-indexing allows you to set up precise code navigation for any chosen repositories with the click of a button, and it makes precise code navigation work across all of your code, automatically. Auto-indexing is supported for 9 languages including Ruby, Rust, Go, Java, Scala, Kotlin, Python, TypeScript, JavaScript, and it is turned on by default for our Cloud customers.

### Your favorite extensions are now available by default 
The most used extensions including code navigation, git-extras, open-in-editor and, search-exports are now default functionality. These enhancements help streamline your workflow and easily switch between tools when needed. Additionally, the current Sourcegraph extensions framework will be deprecated as we work towards a new model of integrations that provides functionality throughout our entire code intelligence platform. Please note, these changes **do not** impact our IDE extensions.

##### üèóÔ∏è High-leverage ways to improve your entire codebase

### Make changes across all of your codebases at enterprise scale with server-side Batch Changes (beta)
Batch Changes allows you to programmatically define changes across the codebase with a single declarative file. Now, changes can be run across thousands of repositories with a better development experience. Previously, you had to run src-cli locally to create batch changes, which could take an impractical amount of time or be brittle for large or resource-intensive batch changes. By running Batch Changes server-side you can:

- Run large-scale or resource-intensive batch changes without clogging your local machine
- Run large batch changes quickly by distributing them across an autoscaled pool of compute instances
- Get a better debugging experience with the streaming of logs directly into Sourcegraph.

This feature requires admins to set up executors (much like CI agents), which Sourcegraph will use to offload expensive tasks. Executors can also be used to run [Code Intelligence auto-indexing](https://github.com/sourcegraph/about/blob/bf341aafde75450c295aaec064470017020cdcd8/content/blogposts/2022/sourcegraph-4.0.md#TODO-link-to-section-or-docs) as well. One or more executors are available by default on Cloud instances of Sourcegraph.

##### ‚òÅÔ∏è Dedicated Sourcegraph Cloud instances for enterprise

### Get started with Sourcegraph faster than ever
After many years of building Sourcegraph into a secure and highly-scalable solution, we're ready to bring it to the cloud. Sourcegraph Cloud now offers dedicated, single-tenant instances of Sourcegraph, making it easier than ever for new teams to get started. You can read more in our announcement blog here[/blog/enterprise-cloud].

##### üíñ For admins

### View usage and measure the value of our platform with new and enhanced in-product analytics
With 3.42, we introduced an all-new analytics including [XYZ]. Our new analytics make it easier for admins to understand user engagement, measure efficiency in terms of time saved, and help calculate the value of utilizing Sourcegraph and its features. We‚Äôve significantly improved our in-product analytics to include the projected value and dev-time-saved for all Sourcegraph features, the ability to export data, individual user usage table, and much more.

### Easily export traces using OpenTelemetry

[OpenTelemetry (OTEL)](https://opentelemetry.io/) is an open specification for exporting observability data into a user‚Äôs preferred systems. We aim to make OpenTelmetry the default way to quickly and easily export observability data from Sourcgraph, starting with tracing in Sourcegraph 4.0. This is a breaking change since we now require customers to export tracing using the [OpenTelemetry collector](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/collector/), which will now be deployed by default in all Sourcegraph deployment methods, replacing the Jaeger agents and collectors we used to ship by default.

### Save time upgrading to Sourcegraph 4.0 with multi-version upgrades
Multi-version upgrades help to reduce the burden and time required to upgrade to the latest version of Sourcegraph. Customers will now be able to seamlessly upgrade from any 3.20+ version to Sourcegraph 4.0 in just a few simple steps. With faster upgrades, customers can quickly start using the new features and enhancements that are released every month.

### Quickly see the status on your repository and sync permissions
With Sourcegraph 4.0, we have introduced more than X quality of life improvements to help admins understand the current state of repository and permissions syncing. This helps to ensure users have the appropriate to repositories so they can understand, fix, and automate the codebase, while admins can XYZ.

### Uncover developer time saved using Browser and IDE extensions 
Admins can now understand the adoption and amount of time saved from using IDE and Browser extensions across your organization. Additionally, to make it faster and easier to roll out our VS Code extension organization wide, we've created an example Batch Change that adds the extension to your repository‚Äôs recommended extensions. Once added, users will be recommended the Sourcegraph extension when opening the repository if they don't have it installed already. We‚Äôve also updated our instructions on how to automatically install our Browser extensions for users in your Google Workspace organization.

### Quickly access answers withing your codebase with a revamped reference panel 
We've enhanced the code navigation experience with a new version of the reference panel. Updates include a new preview panel, the conslidation of definitions and references in the same tab, and allows for easier navigation through filters.
