Last week Sourcegraph turned 4.0. It's been a fantastic journey since we started the company back in 2013, and it seems an appropriate time to take stock of the road behind us and the road ahead. What was the path from serving zero to over one million devs, and what does the road look like ahead to serving many millions more?

### Genesis

For me, there was no single "eureka" moment. Looking back, you can sort of connect some dots.

One of the catalysts was my first programming job out of school.
On the first day, I was handed an app that had passed through five owners over the previous year. The code was not in a great state. Each seemingly simple fix involved a long string of why's, what's—and [wat](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat)'s.

A month into the job, I'd made only a handful of minor fixes. I was meeting expectations, but something felt off.
What got me into programming was a certain *feeling* that I think most devs can relate to. It's the feeling of solving logic puzzles to build something cool, the feeling when you hit enter and the machine comes to life, the feeling you get to experience when you're slinging code at the speed of thought.
Here I was, at the start of my professional programming career, and I'd gone an entire month without experiencing that feeling.

I'd spent nearly all my time trying to understand existing code. And it dawned on me that most of my job was not writing code, but reading it. The problem was that reading code was a lot less fun than writing it!

A couple years later, I caught up with my co-founder, Quinn, and we got to reflecting on our journeys as programmers, and we discovered a mutual yearning for those magical moments when you get to experience *the feeling*. It was not lost on us that this feeling tends to coincide with 10x productivity and that programmer productivity increasingly drives overall technological progress.

Sourcegraph crystallized around those discussions. Code search was a starting point of inspiration for both of us, Quinn having spun up OpenGrok while contributing to open source and I having used code search inside Google. We both realized that search was a versatile tool that could make large codebases tractable by making the winding, forking path of understanding code more fun and straightforward.

But we also dreamt beyond code search of a big intelligent system that had the brain of the most advanced semantic analyzers but awareness of all the code in the world.
It would be a global graph that contained every symbol and reference in the world, that pulled in context from many different compile-time and run-time systems and overlaid this information with precision into every place humans interacted with source.

We wanted to build something that would democratize code understanding and make exploring codebases, no matter how big or how numerous the dependencies, as easy as surfing the web.

### Early iterations

Being over-confident engineers, we estimated it would take us about 3 to 4 months to build this system. What was the MVP of Sourcegraph like?

<center><figcaption>An early iteration of Sourcegraph</figcaption></center>
</figure>

The first release of Sourcegraph was an Angular app. You could search for symbols, jump to definition, and find references in a few languages. Before the world had heard of LSP, we created [srclib](https://srclib.org) to genericize the implementation of code intelligence across different languages. We knew we were onto something when we started using it ourselves and saved a lot of time as we explored and reused open-source libraries.

The next iteration of Sourcegraph, which I'll retroactively label "v1", was a server-side rendered Go web app with minimal JS. We had some pains around initial page load time and thought the ideal "form factor" was more of a snappy content site.

Sourcegraph "2" pivoted back to a rich web application, this time with React and TypeScript. As we acquired more users, it become apparent that a richer UI would, in fact, be beneficial, but we continued to prioritize speed and snappiness as first-class features. We adopted a multi-service architecture for scale, deployed via Kubernetes or a single Docker container.

### Inflection point

In February of 2019, we announced [Sourcegraph 3.0](https://about.sourcegraph.com/blog/sourcegraph-3.0) and open-sourced our core code.
Then things really picked up. The open-core model enabled us to address security concerns and earn developer trust, and the single Docker container enabled any dev to spin up an instance on their local machine, add some private code, and see Sourcegraph in action.

We adopted a layered approach to code navigation that allowed us to support a much wider set of languages.
We supported repository permissions for all major code hosts, something that was critical for enterprises.

Since 3.0, we've shipped many things.

* **Batch Changes** for making big code changes arose out of listening to our customers undertaking big refactors to improve security, code quality, and code reuse
* **Code Insights** to turn any such query into a timeseries graph, embeddable in a dashboard, often used to track patterns and anti-patterns, like adoption of new APIs or accidentally committed secrets, over time.
* **Code Monitors** to alert on those patterns and anti-patterns.
* **Notebooks** to record and transform your code exploration notes into a rich, shareable Markdown docs with embeddable queries and code snippets.
* **A rich query language** that encompasses much more than regex—a plethora of filters and selectors searching over raw code, symbols, diffs, and metadata, along with support for the Comby syntax that makes matching common code patterns far more ergonomic than regex.
* **Precise code navigation** for Go, TypeScript, JavaScript, C++, Java, Scala, Kotlin, and Python, which improves upon the baseline we've established for code navigation in every language.
* **Scalability** to the largest private codebases in the world and over 3 million open-source repositories, including nearly every GitHub repository with more than 5 stars, major projects on GitLab and independent repositories, and code in package hosts like NPM, PyPI, and Maven Central.

Somewhere along the way, we became more than "just code search." By listening closely to our users and customers, we expanded our value proposition to tackle some of the hardest challenges around code understanding for both individual devs and engineering leaders. Unlike most categories of dev tools—code hosts, editors, terminals, CI/CD—Sourcegraph is a bit unique. So we sort of invented a category to place ourselves in, something we call a "Code Intelligence Platform".

It's one thing to list out what the properties of a Code Intelligence Platform are, but like most devs, I prefer to "show, not tell." So here's a whirlwind tour of some of the coolest things you can do in Sourcegraph today:

### Sourcegraph today

#### Search for string literals and regexes, across everywhere code lives

You can search for string literals and regular expressions across millions of repositories across multiple  code hosts (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, anything with a clone URL), version control systems (Git, Perforce, SVN, CVS), and package repositories (npm, PyPI, Maven, crates.io).

String literal and regular expression search have long been core features of code search engines like OpenGrok and Hound, but Sourcegraph scales these to the needs of modern software development, which incorporates vast amounts of code drawn from diverse sources, and ranks the results well. A few examples:

* [(Above) Locate the source of the error message, "At least one model must be passed to register"](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+At+least+one+model+must+be+passed+to+register&patternType=lucky)
* [Locate the same error message, but restricted to PyPI packages](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Epython/+At+least+one+model+must+be+passed+to+register&patternType=lucky)
* [Locate the source of a parameterized error message](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+server+reported+code:+.%2B%2C+message:+.%2B&patternType=regexp)

#### Find functions, packages, and other symbols by keyword

* If you need to implement some auth middleware for your web app, you [search for `auth middleware func`](https://sourcegraph.sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+auth+middleware+func&patternType=lucky)
* If you want to find how to listen for HTTP connections in the Go standard library, [search for `go http listen`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/golang/go%24+type:symbol+http+listen+select:symbol.function&patternType=lucky)

#### Search over history

* [Search diffs, filtered by author "Linus Torvalds"](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+type:diff+author:%22Linus+Torvalds%22&patternType=lucky)
* [Search commit messages, like which ones where Linus has fixed bugs](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+type:commit+author:%22Linus+Torvalds%22+fix+bug&patternType=regexp)
* [Search multiple revisions](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub%5C.com/torvalds/linux%24%40master:v5.19:v5.18+Signal+.%2B+caused+a+tool+exit%2C+line+.%2B&patternType=regexp)
* [Create a context](https://sourcegraph.com/contexts/new) to [search consistent revisions across many repositories](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+repo:%5Egithub.com/gorilla/%40v1.0.0+test&patternType=lucky)

#### Learn by example

A good example is worth a thousand words of documentation. Sourcegraph can show you usage examples pulled from across your organization's code and the world of open source:

* See [the many different ways](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/blob/src/net/http/server.go?L86:6&subtree=true#tab=references) the `http.Handler` interface is used in the Go community. 
* See [implementations of the `http.Handler` interface](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/golang/go/-/blob/src/net/http/server.go?L86:6&subtree=true#tab=implementations_go) across hundreds of third-party libraries.

Precise references are critical when chasing errors down the rabbithole of transitive dependencies and callers, which can sometimes loop back-and-forth across dependency boundaries.

Other web-based code browsers offer regex-based or AST-based code navigation that uses name matching and heuristics to provide somewhat accurate code navigation. Sourcegraph provides this, too, as a fallback when precise code intelligence isn't available, but there is a massive productivity gain that comes with full precise code navigation.

You can configure your codebase for precise code navigation by following [these docs](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/code_intelligence/explanations/precise_code_intelligence).

#### Search beyond regex

* All invocations `fmt.Errorf` with exactly 2 arguments:
  * Comby: [`fmt.Errorf(":[_]", :[[_]])`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+fmt.Errorf%28%22:%5B_%5D%22%2C+:%5B%5B_%5D%5D%29+repo:%5Egithub.com/golang/&patternType=structural)
  * Regex: Not strictly possible. Approximation: [`fmt.Errorf\("[^"]+", \w+\)`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+fmt.Errorf%5C%28%22%5B%5E%22%5D%2B%22%2C+%5Cw%2B%5C%29+repo:%5Egithub.com/golang/&patternType=regexp)

* Invocations of `malloc` within for loops:
  * Comby: [`for (:[_]) { :[_] malloc(:[_]) :[_] }`](https://sourcegraph.com/search?q=context:global+for+%28:%5B_%5D%29+%7B+:%5B_%5D+malloc%28:%5B_%5D%29+:%5B_%5D+%7D+repo:emscripten&patternType=structural)
  * Regex: Not strictly possible, it would be very messy

The [Comby syntax](https://comby.dev/docs/syntax-reference) is simple and straightforward and takes about 5 minutes to learn.

#### Track your train of thought, share with others

#### Write amazing docs

Write amazing docs connecting high-level architecture with entryways into source.

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1646931/184758175-3cc4221d-b3c3-4422-8bed-e2beb94db18d.gif)

You can embed code-intelligence-enabled code snippets in [READMEs with the `.snb.md` file extension](https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/gitpod-io/openvscode-server@docs/-/blob/sourcedive.snb.md) and [external docsites](https://docs.sourcegraph.com/notebooks/notebook-embedding), too.

#### Find anti-patterns in your code, ensure code quality

Sourcegraph can prevent the following classes of anti-patterns:

* Code smells
* Secrets
* Misinvocations of library packages

You can easily turn a search query into a time series chart tracking the occurrence of a pattern over time:

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1646931/184872434-9c8d3425-6d40-4af1-9d0a-3abd7e5a2b06.gif)

There are many different tools for excluding anti-patterns from code. Sourcegraph search is a flexible tool for capturing many such anti-patterns and Sourcegraph also permits you to use your own specific tools for making large-scale changes.


#### Shepherd large-scale changes

Shepherd a large-scale refactor with any code-modification tool, from grep + sed to semantic tools (semgrep, etc)

#### Enhance code review

### The road ahead

Sourcegraph today remains committed to our north star vision of democratizing code understanding.

In the near term, we're focusing on scale—supporting Sourcegraph instances that index some of the largest, oldest, and most complex codebases that power the world's software infrastructure in sectors ranging from banking, healthcare, transportation, social media, and enterprise software.

In parallel, we will continue making open source code widely accessible to every dev and partnering with members of open-source communities as we have in the past on initiatives like these:

* Providing diffs for Rust's `cargo vet` CLI

#### Permissionless innovation

Sourcegraph believes in an open, gatekeeper-less future for code. We believe in developer freedom of choice. The first generations of software were ushered in atop proprietary platforms and vertically integrated walled gardens. But out of this environment emerged open standards, protocols, and platforms that have enabled a Cambrian explosion of software innovation. This is why the web has grown to such prominence, and why the open source ecosystem has been adopted in virtually every company building software.

Today in the world of code, open source has largely won. But that doesn't mean there aren't prevailing forces that seek to recentralize, recapture, and re-vertically integrate how software is made.

Adoption of dev tools should be driven by considerations of which tools are best-in-class for each stage of the lifecycle, not by forced integration or vendor lock-in. Sourcegraph can play a role in ensuring market positions captured by other dev tool companies are not used to constrain developer choice or result in choosing suboptimal tools. We already play this role inside many of our customers who find that using Sourcegraph frees up to adopt different code hosts and editors for different teams. Sourcegraph becomes the common reference point for discussing and sharing code across teams, but individual teams can choose the best editor and code host for them.

Sourcegraph aims to index all the code that exists, wherever it exists. Rather than centralize code onto a specific platform or reduce developer choice through vertical integration, we enable dev teams to choose the best-in-class tool for each stage of the Software Development Lifecycle. This puts us at a bit of unique position relative to most code hosts. We just simply don't believe the best future for software is closed or monolithic—it should remain an open marketplace where upstarts and individuals are free to introduce new innovations to the world without being captive to incumbent distribution channels. This vision sets us apart from many large dev tool and dev infrastructure companies that are driving toward greater bundling and vertical integration.

We believe that code search can play a big role in enabling use of a diverse range of tools for different stages of the SDLC while still providing a common jumping-off point to all the different tools, technologies, and codebases in your organization. It makes understanding tractable without reducing freedom of choice and technical diversity. Web search is a much better starting point for the web than the homepage of msn.com.

We want the next generation of developers to grow up in a world that remains open and becomes even more accessible. It should be easy for newbies to peak under the hood of open source. It should be easy for new hires to pick up the context of the company's codebase. It should be easy to for devs to teach themselves how things work. It should be easy for engineering leaders to gain a clear picture of how the code is evolving. Exploring code should be as seamless and delightful as surfing the web.
